In this dissertation, innovative techniques and methodologies aimed to enhance the performance of MCC applied to a smart city are proposed and investigated.

In particular the UMCC, a global framework that can be adapted depending on the optimization objectives introduced, highlighting the features that can affect the QoS of various types of smart city related applications.

Furthermore, various optimization techniques, based on opportunely defined cost or utility functions, are presented and inspected for the optimization of the resources in the UMCC.

Specifically:

* a partial offloading tecnique is determined for optimizing time and energy consumption in a smart city HetNets scenario, where smart mobile devices are supposed to perform a distributed application;

* a utility function model derived from the economic world has been presented, aiming to measure the QoS, in order to choose the best access point in a HetNet for offloading part of an application on the HetNets;

* a cluster-based optimization technique is proposed and utilized in a distributed computing resource allocation, exploiting resource sharing, in high density SMD environments.

During my Ph.D. course I had the opportunity to collaborate with the Internet Interdisciplinary Institute (IN3) at the Open University of Catalonia (UOC), where I contributed to develop new optimization heuristics for improving heterogeneous communication systems. 
The applied approach is based on the use of biased randomization techniques, which have been used in the past to solve similar combinatorial optimization problems in the fields of logistics, transportation, and production.
This work extends their use to the field of smart cities and mobile telecommunications. Some numerical experiments contribute to illustrate the potential of the proposed approach. 
The outcomes of this research stay are described in Chapter 5.
