title: Acknowledgments
---

This Ph.D. dissertation was carried out during three years of my life in which not only I have gained knowledge and accomplished an academic path, but also I have had the opportunity to proof and enrich my personality. I would like to thank Prof. Giovanni Emanuele Corazza and Prof. Daniele Tarchi for their precious advice and support during my Ph.D. studies. They helped me during every step of my work with unmatched competence and patience.

A sincere thanks goes to Prof. Ángel Alejandro Juan Pérez and Prof. Adela Páges Bernaus for giving me the chance to work with them at the DPCS IN3 Lab of the Open University of Catalonia: for their collaboration and for being always available to share projects and ideas and because my stay in Barcelona has been a unique experience for me, both professionally and personally.

I am also deeply grateful to Prof. Alessandro Vanelli Coralli, Coordinator of the Ph.D. Program in Electronics, Telecommunications, and Information Technologies, for making it possible to carry out this work.

A special acknowledgment goes also to all my colleagues that shared with me many important moments during my time at the University of Bologna - Roberta, Sergio, Vahid, Vincenzo - and at the Internet Interdisciplinary Institute IN3 in Barcelona - Aljoscha, Carlos, Jesica, Laura, Helena.

I also want to thank the reviewers of this thesis, Prof. Flavio Bonomi and Prof. Mohsen Guizani, for their many suggestions and help for greatly improving the quality of this work.

Infine, il piú grande ringraziamento va alla mia famiglia. Grazie a Gabriele, mio compagno di vita, per aver condiviso la mia esperienza e per avermi supportato e incoraggiato, ai miei genitori, per avermi infuso l'amore per lo studio e la ricerca, e a mio figlio Alessandro, che sempre mi ha dato la forza per continuare a dedicarmi alla ricerca.
